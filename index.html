                He told us a very exciting adventure story. Two seats were
                vacant. I would have gotten the promotion, but my attendance
                wasn’t good enough.

                A glittering gem is not enough. I want to buy a onesie… but know
                it won’t suit me. My Mum tries to be cool by saying that she
                likes all the same things that I do. We have a lot of rain in
                June. I was very proud of my nickname throughout high school but
                today- I couldn’t be any different to what my nickname was. I
                currently have 4 windows open up… and I don’t know why.

                What was the person thinking when they discovered cow’s milk was
                fine for human consumption… and why did they do it in the first
                place!?

                The river stole the gods. She did her best to help him. I think
                I will buy the red car, or I will lease the blue one. Should we
                start class now, or should we wait for everyone to get here?
